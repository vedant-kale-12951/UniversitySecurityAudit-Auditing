A comprehensive repository documenting the alignment of IT policies with NIST SP 800-171 standards, focusing on safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Includes detailed findings, recommendations, and implementation steps for improving compliance.
Contents:
Executive Summary:
Objective: Assess IT policy compliance with NIST SP 800-171.
Importance: Enhances data security, builds trust, ensures regulatory compliance, and supports proactive risk management.
Audit Scope:
Policies Reviewed:
Patch Management Policy
Encryption Standard
Configuration and Baseline Standard
Configuration Management Plan
System Services and Asset Lifecycle Management Plan
Key Findings:
Configuration and Baseline Standard:
Strengths: Covers multiple platforms and aligns with NIST SP 800-171 sections 3.4.1[a]-[c].
Gaps: Lacks enforcement documentation, changelog procedures, and training programs.
Configuration Management Plan (CMP):
Strengths: Robust asset inventory, change management, and vulnerability management.
Gaps: Needs improved accessibility and real-time tracking systems.
System Services and Asset Lifecycle Management Plan:
Strengths: Comprehensive lifecycle management from acquisition to disposal.
Gaps: Requires detailed enforcement methods for asset disposal and compliance monitoring.
Patch Management Policy:
Strengths: Timely patch deployment (within 30 days) and role clarity.
Gaps: Missing testing procedures and formal monitoring mechanisms.
Encryption Standard Policy:
Strengths: Well-defined PKI/KMS solutions and segregation of roles.
Gaps: Lacks exception handling procedures and role-specific accountability.
Recommendations:
Increase review frequency (e.g., bi-annual reviews for baseline configurations).
Implement real-time monitoring tools for configuration changes.
Develop training modules for baseline configurations and patch management.
Automate asset inventory updates and integrate advanced vulnerability assessment tools.
Action Plans:
Define enforcement protocols for configuration standards.
Establish metrics to measure the effectiveness of lifecycle management practices.
Create systematic review processes for encryption standards.
Checklists for Compliance:
Detailed audit checklists covering documentation, roles, responsibilities, compliance monitoring, patch deployment timelines, etc.
Supporting Documentation:
Audit report summary.
Templates for policy updates (e.g., Patch Management Policy, Configuration Standards).
Tools & Resources:
Automated tools for inventory management and monitoring compliance.
Visual aids like flowcharts for process illustration.
Training Materials:
Hands-on scenarios for incident response drills.
Awareness programs on encryption standards and patch management.
Compliance Alignment:
Ensures adherence to NIST SP 800-171 standards to protect CUI in non-federal systems.
